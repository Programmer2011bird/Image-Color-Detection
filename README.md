# Image-Color-Detection
A simple program which is for color detection form images. Made in python using opencv and pyqt5

## How it Works
<span>You enter the path to the image you want, Then enter the lowest value of color that you want ( in RGB ), And then the highest. After that the program will detect colors in range and show it</span>

## Use Cases
<span> In Astronomy we get images from telescopes that can have so much detail and small objects in the background; these background small objects often are red because of the distance that light has to travel, finding these Really Small Objects in the background is no easy so we can use color detection apps like this one. </span>

> [!CAUTION]
> The Program doesn't have any error controls, so when you are enter the colors please don't enter any number higher than 255 (Highest number in uint8 which is used for colors)
